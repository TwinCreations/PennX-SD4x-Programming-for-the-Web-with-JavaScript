In this assignment, you will use Node.js and Express to develop a Web API that provides services related to data stored in a MongoDB database.

This assignment continues the “pet store” theme from previous assignments. In this case, you will build a Web API that allows applications to get information about the pets at the store and the pet toys that the store sells.

In completing this assignment, you will:

    Learn how to set up Node, Express, Mongo, and related packages

    Apply what you have learned about developing a Node Express app and using various objects and functions

    Implement JavaScript queries using Mongoose to retrieve data from a MongoDB database

    Create a server-side Web application that reads data from an incoming HTTP request and sends back JSON data in an HTTP response
