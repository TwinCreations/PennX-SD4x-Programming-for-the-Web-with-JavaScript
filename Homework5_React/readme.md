In this assignment, you will develop a simple application to track lists of items using React.

The application you will be building has many components that work together in order to organize multiple lists. Such an app could theoretically be used to create a shopping list, a set of daily tasks, or so forth.

In completing this assignment, you will:

    Gain experience understanding and modifying an existing React app

    Use the Node framework to create and deploy a React app with multiple components defined in separate files

    Gain more experience in implementing callback functions in React components that affect the componentsâ€™ appearance

    Apply what you have learned in the lessons about the relationships between React components and how components interact
